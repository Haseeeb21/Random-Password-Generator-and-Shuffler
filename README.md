## Random Password Generator

The passgenerator_gui file contains the code.

### Working

Different libraries are used for different purpose.

This is a GUI based code which uses tkinter library.

A class named PasswordGenerator is made in which the GUI code is present and as well as two different functions. One is used to generate the random password and the other is used to copy the generated text / password. And then the class object is made when the code runs.

We have to enter the length of the password we want to generate and then after pressing the `Generate Password` button the password is generated. After every press the password is generated again and again.

We can see the letters that the password will contain. They are displayed Alphabets, Numbers and Punctuations (the password will contain mixture of these).

By pressing the `Copy Password` button the generated password is copied to user clipboard and you can paste it anywhere.

## Password / Words Shuffler 

This shuffles the password we provide as input.

### Working

This will first take an input from the user as string. The user inputs the password / word. Then the user inputs the number of times ton shuffle.

After entering both the values then the use will be displayed with generated `Shuffled Passwords`.
